# Project Progress Log

This log captures high-level project steps with timestamps. The companion machine-readable state is at project-log/progress_state.json.

- 2025-11-04 00:00 UTC — Initialized persistent progress logging.
  - Added project-log/PROGRESS_LOG.md and project-log/progress_state.json
  - Intention: after any meaningful step, append an entry here and update progress_state.json so the agent can restore context after restarts.
  - Current focus: Pure-frontend demo (branch feat-check-frontend-standalone-chem-test), Cloudflare Pages project chem-guess-demo (404 pending because no active production deployment yet). Provided Paths: A) Git integration then switch Production branch; B) Direct Upload via Wrangler.

- 2025-11-04 00:00 UTC — Policy acknowledged.
  - All subsequent steps must be committed and pushed to GitHub.
  - All shell/CLI actions to be run with elevated privileges where applicable.
